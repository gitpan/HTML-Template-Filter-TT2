NAME

    HTML::Template::Filter::TT2 - Template Toolkit 2 syntax for HTML::Template


DESCRIPTION

    This "HTML::Template" filter allows you to use the Template Toolkit 2
    syntax, which is much less verbose than the default syntax. This is not
    an emulation of TT2, so you're still limited to the usual HTML::Template 
    semantics. Also, in order to keep the filter fast and simple, the 
    "[% end %]" must be written with the block name. See below for details.
